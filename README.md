# Mastermind

A game of skill and logic in which one player must solve a secret code!

This project was inspired by The Odin Project: Full Stack Ruby on Rails curriculum. 

## Functionality

This game is intended to be played within the users terminal. The program itself utilizes object oriented methodolgies, conditional logic, loops, arrays, and built-in methods in its execution.

## Rules & Objective

    - The objective of this game is to solve a code set randomly by the computer within 12 guesses. Users can also play as the code master and set a code for the computer to solve

    - The code is made up of 4 unique characters, each representing a colour that was randomly selected from an array of six unique colours (R - Red, B - Blue, G - Green, Y - Yellow, P - Purple, O - Orange)

    - Following every guess the guesser (whether it be the computer or the user) will recieve feedback that will allow him/her to narrow down the correct code possibilities 

Enjoy!
